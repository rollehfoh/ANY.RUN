# Microsoft Sentinel Connectors for ANY.RUN Interactive Malware Sandbox

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary resources for integrating Microsoft Sentinel with the ANY.RUN Sandbox. The connectors enrich Microsoft Sentinel incidents by analyzing URLs or files associated with them in the ANY.RUN Sandbox.

As a result, your Microsoft Sentinel incidents will include a verdict, threat score, malware tags and a link to the detailed analysis in the ANY.RUN UI, allowing you to explore the object's behavior in a real infrastructure environment. Additionally, your Threat Intelligence portal in Sentinel will be enriched with Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) extracted during the sandbox analysis.

## Analyze URLs from Microsoft Sentinel Incidents via ANY.RUN Sandbox

This playbook extracts URL from incidents and submit it for analysis in the ANY.RUN Sandbox to enrich the incident with a verdict using a single Azure Logic App.

## Analyze Files from Microsoft Sentinel Incidents via ANY.RUN Sandbox

This playbook allows you to send files from incidents for analysis in the ANY.RUN Sandbox. It uploads the file from the endpoint to Azure Blob Storage and then forwards it to the ANY.RUN Sandbox using an Azure Logic App.

Templates are provided for endpoints running the following operating systems:
- Windows
- UNIX (Ubuntu, Debian)

## Analyze All Entities from Microsoft Sentinel Incidents via ANY.RUN Sandbox and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

This template makes the incident enrichment process in Microsoft Sentinel even more automated if you are also using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE). In this case, the entire automation mechanism can be combined into a single Azure Logic App, leveraging MDE's capabilities to extract files from endpoints via API.

## Prerequisites

### Key Vault

- You need the Hunter pricing plan in ANY.RUN and your API key. We recommend storing your API key in Azure Key Vault. To do this, select your existing Key Vault or create a new one. Then, navigate to the **Objects** > **Secrets** section and create a new secret named `ANYRUN-APIKey`.

  > **Note:** It is recommended to keep this name unchanged, as otherwise, you will need to update it later in the deployed Logic App.

### App Registration and API Permissions

- If you haven't done this before, you need to create a new application for your connector. To do this, go to **Microsoft Entra ID**.

- Click **Add** > **App registration**

- Name your new application and click **Register**

- For the created application, add the following permissions for API connections in the **Manage** > **API permissions** > **Add a permission** tab:

![add_permission](images/007.png)

- In the **Microsoft APIs** tab, add **Azure Key Vault**.

![add_vault_permission](images/005.png)

- Add the following permissions for it:

| Category | Permission Name   | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| N/A      | user_impersonation | Allow the application full access to the Azure Key Vault service on behalf of the signed-in user |

- Next, add an API connection for **WindowsDefenderATP**. Select the corresponding API in the **APIs my organization uses** tab.

  > **Note:** This is only required for workflows where you use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) to extract files from the endpoint.

- Then, select **Application permissions**.

- Select the following permissions:

| Category | Permission Name    | Description                                                                 |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Machine  | Machine.LiveResponse | Needed to gather evidences from machines                                  |
| Machine  | Machine.Read.All   | Needed to retrieve information about machines                               |
| Library  | Library.Manage     | Needed to upload custom ps1 script for retrieving AV related evidences     |

### Deployment

- After completing the preliminary settings above, you can proceed to deploy the Azure Logic Apps necessary for integrating Microsoft Sentinel and ANY.RUN Sandbox:
  - [ANYRUN-Sandbox-URL](https://github.com/rollehfoh/ANY.RUN/tree/main/connectors/Microsoft/MS%20Sentinel%20SIEM-SOAR/ANYRUN-Sandbox-URL)
  - [ANYRUN-Sandbox-File](https://github.com/rollehfoh/ANY.RUN/tree/main/connectors/Microsoft/MS%20Sentinel%20SIEM-SOAR/ANYRUN-Sandbox-File)
  - [ANYRUN-Sandbox-Defender](https://github.com/rollehfoh/ANY.RUN/tree/main/connectors/Microsoft/MS%20Sentinel%20SIEM-SOAR/ANYRUN-Sandbox-Defender)

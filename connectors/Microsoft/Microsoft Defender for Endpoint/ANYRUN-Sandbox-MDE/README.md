# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Connector for ANY.RUN Malware Sandbox

## Overview

This connector integrates Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) with the ANY.RUN Sandbox to enrich MDE alerts through automated malware analysis. It triggers automatically upon the registration of a new alert in MDE, extracting and analyzing entities such as URLs or files associated with the alert.

The enrichment process adds valuable context directly to the alert: comments include the ANY.RUN verdict, threat score, a link to the detailed analysis report, and any Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) discovered during the sandbox detonation. Extracted IoCs are also imported into MDE's local Threat Intelligence lists for enhanced detection and response.

This integration empowers SOC teams with deeper insights into potential threats, accelerating triage, reducing false positives, and enabling proactive hunting â€” all while leveraging ANY.RUN's interactive sandbox capabilities for real-time behavioral analysis.

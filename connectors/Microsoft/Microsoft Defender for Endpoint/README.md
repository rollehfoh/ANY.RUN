# ANY.RUN Connectors for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

This repository provides connectors that enable interoperability between Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrungithub&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=ms_defender_main&utm_content=linktolanding)'s services:  

* [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/features/?utm_source=anyrungithub&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=ms_defender_main&utm_content=linktosandboxlanding)
* [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrungithub&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=ms_defender_main&utm_term=310725&utm_content=linktofeedslanding) 

The connector automates threat analysis from MDE alerts by retrieving up-to-date data from sandbox detonations of associated objects, enriching alerts with relevant intelligence to optimize investigations.

## Malware Sandbox Connector

The connector automatically sends MDE alerts’ suspicious files and URLs to ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox for analysis and attaches the results (verdict, risk score, malware details) to the alert as comments. This helps SOC teams gain real-time insights into evasive threats, enabling faster triage, reduced false positives, and proactive response to minimize remediation time.

## Threat Intelligence Feeds Connector

The connector pulls fresh, high-fidelity threat indicators (IPs, domains, URLs, and file hashes), extracted from real-time detonations of the latest threats inside ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox, and feeds them straight into MDE’s threat lists. Updated in real time with threat data from over 15,000 SOCs around the world, TI Feeds enable teams to spot new threats sooner, block them faster, and connect the dots between alerts for smarter investigations and quicker response.

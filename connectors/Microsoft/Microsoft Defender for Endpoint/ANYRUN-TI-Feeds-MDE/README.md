# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Connector for ANY.RUN Threat Inteligence Feeds

## Overview

ANY.RUN’s [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrungithub&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=opencti_feeds&utm_content=linktofeedslanding) (TI Feeds) is a continuously updated source of fresh network-based Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IPs, domains, and URLs. 

The IOCs are extracted from real-time analyses done by experts from 15,000 companies in ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox. 

### Connector’s functionality 

The connector for Threat Intelligence Feeds provides Microsoft Defenderfor Endpoint (MDE) users with simple, automated access to uniquely sourced and accurate indicators of compromise.

- Detect threats early and prevent attacks using high-quality indicators 

### Key SOC benefits 

Integrate TI Feeds with MDE for an easy access to all the benefits it brings:  

- Expanded Coverage: ANY.RUN’s exclusive IOCs come from Memory Dumps, Suricata IDS, in-browser data, and internal threat categorization systems, increasing the chance of detection of the most evasive threats.
